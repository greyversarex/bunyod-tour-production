# Bunyod-Tour Backend API

## Overview
Bunyod-Tour is a comprehensive tourism booking platform for Central Asia, offering tour, hotel, and guide booking, secure payments, and administrative management. The platform aims to provide a seamless user experience and efficient tools for administrators, supporting multilingual content and diverse payment methods. The project seeks to modernize and streamline regional tourism services, tapping into significant market potential.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Development approach: Improve existing files rather than creating new ones. User prefers enhancement of existing admin-dashboard.html over creation of separate admin panels.
Frontend structure alignment: Admin panel must perfectly match the frontend homepage structure with exact block names and tour organization as shown in provided screenshots.
System integration preference: User requires simplified and unified pricing systems with single source of truth. Eliminated complex manual categorization in favor of automatic detection.
Pricing logic: All tour types (including "Групповой общий") use the same per-person multiplication when priceType is "за человека".

**CRITICAL WORK RULE**: Before starting any task, conduct thorough research of all related code, structure, dependencies, and potential impacts. Nothing should be broken or damaged. Work must be performed with utmost professionalism and responsibility. Quality is paramount.

## System Architecture

### Backend
The backend utilizes **Express.js and TypeScript** with a **modular architecture** following an **MVC pattern**. It supports full CRUD operations, multilingual content (Russian, English), and robust JWT authentication for Admin, Tour Guide, and Driver roles.

### Database
**PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM** is used for data management. The schema includes entities like **Tours**, **Categories**, **TourBlocks**, **TourCategoryAssignment**, **TourGuideProfile**, **DriverProfile**, **Countries**, **Cities**, and **CityCardPhoto**. The system features automatic database initialization, schema application, data seeding for reference data, and a smart category migration system for a standardized 15-category structure. Tours now support **multiple categories** and **multiple countries/cities** through junction tables.

### Key Features

### Production Deployment Infrastructure
-   **TypeScript Compilation Strategy**: Production uses pre-compiled JavaScript from `./dist/`.
-   **Deployment System**: Automated via `./update.sh` script, uses PM2 for process management, Nginx as a reverse proxy, and a `GET /healthz` endpoint for monitoring.
-   **Migration Strategy**: Two-tier system for database changes:
    -   **Manual Migrations**: Stored in `manual_migrations/` directory for complex schema changes (e.g., TEXT to JSONB conversions). Automatically executed by `update.sh` before Prisma migrations.
    -   **Prisma Migrations**: Standard migrations via `prisma migrate deploy` for routine schema updates.
-   **Multilingual Data Architecture**: Uses PostgreSQL JSONB fields with `{ru: "text", en: "text"}` structure for all multilingual content (slides, tour data, etc.). Controllers guarantee both language keys exist to prevent API errors.
-   **Rate Limiting Security**: All rate limiters configured with `validate: {trustProxy: false}` to work properly behind Nginx reverse proxy in production.
